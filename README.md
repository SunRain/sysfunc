**SysFunc** is a shell library primarily intended for Unix sysadmins.

It provides a set of portable shell functions including features such as :

- file copy,
- symbolic link management,
- file/directory deletion,
- user/group management,
- data block or line replacement in a file,
- commenting/uncommenting a line,
- service management,
- volume group/logical volume/file system creation
- and much more...

The library was tested on Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX. Actually, it
should run on any Unix/Linux system.
